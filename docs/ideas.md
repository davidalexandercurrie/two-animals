# Ideas

- **Goals System** - Add immediate/short-term/long-term goals to NPCs to give them direction beyond reactive behavior
- **Contract Context Reduction** - Implement sliding window or summarization to prevent context bloat in long interactions
- **Environments & Objects** - Add environmental entities (rivers, clearings) and objects (stones, food) that have state/history but no intents
- **Object Ownership** - Objects can be carried by NPCs (ownership = physical possession), enabling pick up/drop/give/take mechanics
- **Richer Personalities** - Update NPC personalities and initial memories to include quirks, contradictions, and more complex traits
- **Hidden Story Elements** - GM-known events/mysteries that unfold through NPC interactions and environmental clues, discovered by player through exploration
- **Dynamic Creation System** - Allow GM to create items, environments, and even characters during gameplay through natural language, stored in a database for persistence
- **Group/Faction Formation** - NPCs naturally form alliances, packs, or factions based on shared experiences, resources, threats, or compatible personalities
- **Trust Networks** - NPCs maintain trust levels with each other affecting information sharing, alliance formation, and contract willingness
- **Information Flow/Gossip** - NPCs share information based on trust, creating organic rumor spreading and secret keeping within the social network
- **Social Memory** - Dedicated memory slots for relationships, group affiliations, shared stories, and social knowledge that influence NPC behavior
- **Persistent World** - Server-based worlds where NPCs continue living/interacting while players are offline, creating emergent stories and shifting dynamics to discover upon return
